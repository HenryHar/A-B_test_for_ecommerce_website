# UD-A-B_testing
This repository contains my second project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

Included files:
1. ab_data.csv    this file contains the a/b test results, file was given by Udacity
2. countries.csv  this file contains the user's country of origin

How to use:

If you are interested in the project, you may simple click the 'Analyzing_A_B_test...' file and the Jupyter notebook file should open on github.

License: You may use any part of my work/code unless you are a fellow Udacity student enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In that case please reach out to me if you need any help completing your project :)

Expected revisions:

-I will condense the write-up and make it a standalone document.
